The Python code is already pretty solid and follows good practices. Here are some minor improvements that could be made:

1. Use of Docstrings: Python Docstrings could be added to classes and functions to provide a description of what they do. This would make the code more understandable for other developers.

2. Consistent use of single or double quotes: There's inconsistent usage of single and double quotes for strings. Choose one and stick with it throughout the code.

3. Ordering of imports: Imports could be ordered alphabetically and grouped by standard library, third-party and local application/library specific.

Here is the modified version of the same code:

```python
"""
This module defines various models related to Users, Transactions, Incomes and Budgets.
"""

import logging
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from flask_login import UserMixin
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

from extensions import db

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
UTC = timezone.utc

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    """User model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...

class Transaction(db.Model):
    """Transaction model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...

class UserIncome(db.Model):
    """UserIncome model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...

class CustomIncome(db.Model):
    """CustomIncome model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...

class SavingsGoal(db.Model):
    """SavingsGoal model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...

class Budget(db.Model):
    """Budget model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...

class UserCategoryPreference(db.Model):
    """UserCategoryPreference model"""
    # ...
    # Same code here
    # ...
```

In the code above, I've added docstrings to each class to describe what they represent. The rest of the changes are mostly cosmetic and don't change the functionality of the code.
