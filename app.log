2024-11-05 21:28:14,558 - INFO - OpenAI response: To save better next month, consider the following tips:

1. Create a budget: Start by tracking your income and expenses to understand where your money is going. Allocate a portion of your income to savings each month.

2. Set savings goals: Determine what you are saving for, whether it's an emergency fund, a vacation, or a big purchase. Having specific goals can help keep you motivated to save.

3. Cut unnecessary expenses: Review your spending habits and identify areas where you can cut back. This could include dining out less, canceling unused subscriptions, or finding cheaper alternatives.

4. Automate your savings: Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account each month. This way, you won't even have to think
